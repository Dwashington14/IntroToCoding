# Setting up your Environment
---

We will first set up the tools and resources we need to succeed in class. Then, we will set up tools and resources needed to write code.

### Setting up your classroom environment
---
Please set up a **[GitHub](https://www.github.com)** account. **Make sure you also verify your email** after setting up your account.

I have developed a suite of tools that we will use in class to make our lives easier.


##### [Autosync](http://autosync.io/#/course/Taq/0)
Live class notes. For the duration of the class, all code written on my machine will be available to you in _real time_ via [Autosync](http://autosync.io/#/course/Taq/0).

##### [GitBot](http://gitbot.co/#home)
We will use [GitBot](http://gitbot.co/#home) to deploy our webpages to the internets. You will need this in class, for homework, and generally in life.

##### [Samantha](http://fewd.us/samantha/)
Samantha is an online coding environment. We will learn javascript in [Samantha](http://fewd.us/samantha/) + it is super useful for doing quick experiments / during office hours. 

...There are more, but for now, these should suffice. Check out some of my writings on tools and such on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/).

### Setting up your code environment
---

Before we can begin our exercises in wizardry, we must download and install a few relevant programs.

These programs are going to help us write code, transfer code to servers, and view the results of our code in the browser.

#### Sublime Text

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) &mdash; code editor &mdash; you'll be writing code here. This is a free tool, but they will ask you to donate every few saves. However, you can use the program for free as long as you'd like.

#### Chrome
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) &mdash; web browser &mdash; you'll use this to view your code assignments. So free it hurts.
